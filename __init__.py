# Richard Darst, 2008

# This __init__.py file exists so that the entire dragunov directory
# can be placed in your python modules import path and it will Just
# Work.  While this isn't the ideal situation, nothing prevents you
# from copying over just dragunov.py and dragunov_c.so to the python
# path.

# This might have to be later changed to be a relative import;
# importing a module named `dragunov` from within a module named
# `dranugov` is sort of iffy.

from dragunov import *
